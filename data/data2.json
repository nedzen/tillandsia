It solves the problem of the most common support requests typically related to recently placed orders. We wanted to create a product that let customers handle these operations themselves. Doing this would reduce support requests by 20-30%. The self-service portal can also host the merchant's brand documentation structured on topics, FAQs and facilitate access to more direct support methods. Its backend config is accessible inside the Gorgias helpdesk. The self-service portal can be deployed as a standalone module on its subdomain URL or be triggered within the Gorgias support widget upon specific support queries.",

This product operates on three different platforms; within the support chat widget, as a standalone website, and the backend within the Gorgias helpdesk.
